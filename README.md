# Architecture Design and Decisions

# Requirements 

Install `adr-tools` as described here: [Install Instructions](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

# Usage

To define a new Architecture Decision run the following command: 

```sh
adr new <title>

The `title` parameter should give a clear idea of the decision that should be enforced in regards to development in the project.
